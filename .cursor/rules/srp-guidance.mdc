# SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

ðŸŽ¯ **Rule Triggered:** Class or function modification/addition.

**Core Principle:** A class or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

**Action Required:**
- Examine the modified/added class or function. What is its primary responsibility?
- Does it handle multiple, distinct concerns (e.g., data fetching AND presentation AND business logic)?
- Could its responsibilities be logically separated into smaller, more focused units (classes, functions, modules)?
- Are the boundaries between responsibilities clear?

**Reference:** Discussed in @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (SOLID Principles section).

**Decision Point:** If a component appears to violate SRP by handling multiple unrelated responsibilities, propose refactoring options to the user.

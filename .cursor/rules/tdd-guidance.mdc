# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guidance

ðŸ§ª **Rule Triggered:** Code modified in `src/` but not `tests/`.

**Core Principle:** Write meaningful tests *before* implementation. Validate edge cases, failure modes, and expected behavior. Include prompt tests for LLM logic changes.

**Action Required:**
- If adding new functionality: Have you written tests for it first in the `tests/` directory?
- If modifying existing functionality: Have you updated corresponding tests in `tests/` to reflect the changes?
- If modifying AI interactions (e.g., prompts, PydanticAI models): Have you added or updated relevant prompt tests (e.g., using promptfoo)?

**Reference:** See @docs/TESTING.md for detailed strategies and examples.

**Decision Point:** If the testing strategy for this change is unclear, please clarify with the user.

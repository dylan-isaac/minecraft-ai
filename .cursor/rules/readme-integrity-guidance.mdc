# README Integrity: CLI Commands

ðŸ”‘ **Rule Triggered:** Modification of `README.md`.

**Core Principle:** The root `README.md` must serve as the primary, immediately accessible reference for essential project setup and CLI commands.

**Action Required:**
- Verify that the "CLI Commands" section is present and accurate.
- Ensure all critical commands (`start`, `pat test`, `pat lint`, etc.) are listed, preferably in a table format.
- Do **not** remove or relocate these essential command references to other documentation files. They must remain in the root README for discoverability.

**Reference:** The structure defined in @README.md.

**Decision Point:** If considering removing or significantly altering the CLI commands section in the README, confirm this deviation with the user, as it goes against project standards.

# Documentation Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to all documentation in the PydanticAI API Template project.

## Core Documentation

| Documentation | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| [README.md](../README.md) | High-level project overview and quick start |
| [Developer Guide](./DEVELOPER.md) | Setup instructions and development workflows |
| [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | System design, patterns, and component relationships |
| [Models](./MODELS.md) | Pydantic models, validation, and PydanticAI integration |
| [API Reference](./API.md) | API endpoints, parameters, and response formats |
| [Testing Guide](./TESTING.md) | Testing strategies and examples |
| [Maintenance](./MAINTENANCE.md) | Configuration management and project maintenance |
| [Observability](./OBSERVABILITY.md) | Logging, tracing, and monitoring with Logfire |
| [Cursor Rules](./CURSOR_RULES.md) | AI-assisted development with Cursor |

## Documentation Organization

The documentation is organized to support different user roles:

- **New Users**: Start with README.md for a project overview
- **Developers**: Focus on DEVELOPER.md and API.md
- **DevOps**: Refer to MAINTENANCE.md and OBSERVABILITY.md
- **Architects**: Dive into ARCHITECTURE.md and MODELS.md
- **QA Engineers**: Concentrate on TESTING.md

## Using AI for Documentation Assistance

This project is designed to work well with AI-assisted development tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/). The documentation is structured to provide maximum benefit for AI context:

1. **Referencing Documentation in Cursor**:
   - Use the `@docs/FILENAME.md` syntax in Cursor to reference documentation
   - Example: `@docs/MODELS.md` to bring model information into context

2. **AI-Assisted Documentation Updates**:
   - When implementing new features, ask Cursor to help update relevant docs
   - Example: "Update API.md to document the new endpoint I just created"

3. **Documentation-Driven Development**:
   - Consider writing specification documentation before implementation
   - Use AI to transform specifications into working code

## Cursor Rules Integration

To further enhance the development workflow, this project includes [Cursor Rules](./CURSOR_RULES.md) that:

1. **Provide timely reminders** about documentation updates
2. **Enforce code quality standards** like type safety
3. **Suggest improvements** based on project patterns
4. **Promote accessibility** in user-facing components

See [Cursor Rules](./CURSOR_RULES.md) for detailed information on how to leverage these rules effectively.

## Wishlist Documentation

The `wishlist/` directory contains markdown files for future improvements and features. This serves as:

1. A feature backlog for planning
2. A source of implementation targets for AI-assisted development
3. A collaborative planning tool for the team

## Best Practices for Documentation

1. **Keep Documentation Updated**: Documentation should be updated alongside code changes
2. **Include Examples**: Concrete examples help users understand functionality
3. **Cross-Reference**: Link between related documentation sections
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure documentation is accessible to all users
5. **AI-Friendly Structure**: Use clear headings, code blocks, and consistent terminology

## Documentation Map

| Document | Purpose | When to Use | Key Sections |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| [README.md](../README.md) | Project introduction and central hub | First point of contact, quick start | Quick Start, Features, Documentation Map |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) | System design and patterns | Understanding overall design | Component diagrams, Integration patterns |
| [API.md](./API.md) | API endpoint specifications | Working with or extending the API | Endpoints, Request/Response formats |
| [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) | Development workflows and setup | Daily development tasks | Setup, Commands, Best practices |
| [MODELS.md](./MODELS.md) | Pydantic model details | Working with data models | Model definitions, Validation patterns |
| [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) | Testing strategies | Writing or running tests | Testing patterns, Examples |
| [OBSERVABILITY.md](./OBSERVABILITY.md) | Observability and testing infrastructure | Setting up monitoring, writing tests | LogFire integration, Testing setup |
| [MAINTENANCE.md](./MAINTENANCE.md) | Project maintenance and configuration | Updating dependencies, configuration | Configuration files, Sync tools |
| [Wishlist](../wishlist/) | Future improvements and feature ideas | Planning future work, AI-assisted implementations | Feature requests, Implementation details |

## Documentation Flow

The documentation is designed to follow a natural workflow:

1. **Start with README.md** - Get a high-level overview of the project
2. **Follow with DEVELOPER.md** - Set up your development environment
3. **Consult specialized docs** - Refer to specific docs as needed for your task
4. **Reference MAINTENANCE.md** - When making configuration changes

## Documentation for Specific Tasks

| Task | Primary Docs | Secondary Docs |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Setting up the project | README.md, DEVELOPER.md | MAINTENANCE.md |
| Adding a new API endpoint | API.md | MODELS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Creating a new Pydantic model | MODELS.md | API.md |
| Writing tests | TESTING.md, OBSERVABILITY.md | API.md, MODELS.md |
| Setting up monitoring | OBSERVABILITY.md | DEVELOPER.md |
| Updating configuration | MAINTENANCE.md | DEVELOPER.md |
| Understanding the system | ARCHITECTURE.md | MODELS.md, API.md |
| Adding MCP server tools | ARCHITECTURE.md | API.md |
| Proposing future features | Wishlist | ARCHITECTURE.md, MODELS.md |

## Accessibility Considerations

All documentation follows these accessibility principles:

1. **Clear structure** - Consistent headings and organization
2. **Simple language** - Avoiding unnecessary jargon
3. **Alt text for images** - Descriptive text for diagrams
4. **Semantic markup** - Using appropriate Markdown elements
5. **Color-independent** - Information doesn't rely solely on color
6. **Concise content** - Focused on essential information

## Updating Documentation

When updating documentation:

1. **Maintain consistency** - Follow existing patterns
2. **Update cross-references** - Check links between documents
3. **Add to README.md** - Update the Documentation Map when adding new docs
4. **Remove outdated content** - Don't let obsolete information persist
5. **Include examples** - Practical examples help understanding
6. **Consider the audience** - New users and experienced developers have different needs

For a detailed guide on what documentation to update when making specific types of changes, see the [Documentation Maintenance](./MAINTENANCE.md#documentation-maintenance) section in MAINTENANCE.md.
